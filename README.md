# Self-Driving-Car
# READ THE NOTES IN TEXT FILE PROVIDED AS RESOURCES ARE TOO BIG.


We're going to use Udacity's car simulator app as an environment to create our own autonomous agent! We'll use Keras to train a convolutional neural network on images from the car's cameras as well as steering angles from human driving. Using just those 2 data points, it'll be able to drive itself on any road.
