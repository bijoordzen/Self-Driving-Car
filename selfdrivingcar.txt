Notes:-
1)It can be implemented in nine lines of keras
2)Udacity Self Driving Simulator built with unity.
3)Gravity,momentum,acceleration already added in simulator.
4)Got two moddes training and autonomous
5)Three parts 
a)Data generation
b)training 
c)testing
6)9 layer cnn,attached three cameras and made human drive the car
7)Cameras used to collect data
8)What was the  Data:- steering commands and camera feed.
Four physics variable:-1) angle,speed,throttle,break along with associated video feed from cameras center ,left ,right.
9)Data saved in .csv files.
10)Machine learning will clone the behaviour of how the human will drive the car .This is called as behavioral cloning.
11)Data goes into Nvidia Drive PX Card and is saved in an ssd 
12)Steering commands fed inside the GPU is taken 1/r and not r to make system independent of car geometry.
13)Computing loss between autonomus vs human generated data and reduce by backpropagation by updating weights.
For testing we have server and client like architecture 
server is simulator 
client is our python program 
and both server and client will be in feedback loop.



HOW TO RUN ? 
first give permission to beta_simulator.x86_64 to run as exe by right clicking on it 
then run the beta_simulator.x86_64 in training mode 
use w,a,s,d or arrow keys to move the car 
For creating the .csv file the recorded video will pe replayed and images will be captured.
press r to record the training and r again to pause the training to generate .csv file 


first on ubuntu create environment using this command by being in this directory.

conda env create environments.yml 

After that activate the environment 

source activate car-behavioral-cloning

Then for compiling and creating model file give path of created .csv file into model.py file  and run model.py file

python model.py


for keras upgrade version np.var
