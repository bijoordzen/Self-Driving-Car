Notes:-
1)It can be implemented in nine lines of keras
2)Udacity Self Driving Simulator built with unity.
3)Gravity,momentum,acceleration already added in simulator.
4)Got two moddes training and autonomous
5)Three parts 
a)Data generation
b)training 
c)testing
6)9 layer cnn,attached three cameras and made human drive the car
7)Cameras used to collect data
8)What was the  Data:- steering commands and camera feed.
Four physics variable:-1) angle,speed,throttle,break along with associated video feed from cameras center ,left ,right.
9)Data saved in .csv files.
10)Machine learning will clone the behaviour of how the human will drive the car .This is called as behavioral cloning.
11)Data goes into Nvidia Drive PX Card and is saved in an ssd 
12)Steering commands fed inside the GPU is taken 1/r and not r to make system independent of car geometry.
13)Computing loss between autonomus vs human generated data and reduce by backpropagation by updating weights.
For testing we have server and client like architecture 
server is simulator 
client is our python program 
and both server and client will be in feedback loop.


HOW TO RUN ? 
some download links 
:- https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim
:- https://github.com/llSourcell/How_to_simulate_a_self_driving_car
:- https://github.com/naokishibuya/car-behavioral-cloning

1)Download Linux/Ubuntu version of beta_simulator.x86_64.No need to install unity then give permission to beta_simulator.x86_64 to run as exe by right clicking on it then run the beta_simulator.x86_64 in training mode 
2)use w,a,s,d or arrow keys to move the car 
3)For creating the .csv file the recorded video will pe replayed and images will be captured.
4)Press r to record the training and r again to pause the training to generate .csv file 
5)first on ubuntu create environment using this command by being in this directory.
   conda env create environments.yml 

6)After that activate the environment 
   source activate car-behavioral-cloning
7)after that install the req.txt file provided in the repo to update the packages.

8)after that update all the packages in the environment using below command

   pip list --outdated --format=freeze | grep -v '^\-e' | cut -d = -f 1  | xargs -n1 pip install -U



9)Then for compiling and creating model file give path of created .csv file into model.py file  and run model.py file

  python model.py
